# Countdown to KO #9: Deploying Your Node.js App to Heroku

*This is the 9th in series of posts leading up [Node.js Knockout][1], and
covers deploying your Node.js app to the [Heroku][2] platform.*

[1]: http://nodeknockout.com
[2]: http://heroku.com

Heroku is a platform that lets you deploy your Node.js app instantly,
without needing to deal with servers or systems administration.   The
recently-released [Celadon Cedar][3] stack supports Node.js (alongside
other languages such as Ruby and Clojure).  You can also use backing
services such as SQL or NoSQL databases, memcached, and [many others
available as add-ons][4].  Manage everything from the Heroku
command-line tool, and deploy your code using Git.

This post will get you going with a Node.js/[Express][5] app on Heroku
Cedar.

Sign Up for a Heroku Account
----------------------------

If you don't already have a Heroku account, visit [the signup page][6]
to create an account.  It's free and just takes a minute.  Once you sign
up, you'll receive an invitation email that will allow you to set your
password.

Install the Heroku Command-line Client
--------------------------------------

If you have Rubygems on your system, you can install the Heroku client
with:

    $ gem install heroku

Otherwise, download [this tarball][7], extract it, and put the resulting
directory into your `$PATH`:

    $ wget http://assets.heroku.com/heroku-client/heroku-client.tgz
    Saving to: `heroku-client.tgz'
    100%[==================================================================>] 412,661      535K/s   in 0.8s

    $ tar xzf heroku-client.tgz && echo "Add $PWD/heroku-client to your \$PATH."
    Add /Users/adam/heroku-client to your $PATH.

You will need `ruby` in your path, which is available by default on Mac
OS X, can be installed on Ubuntu with `apt-get install ruby-dev`, or on
Windows with [RubyInstaller][8].

Run `heroku login` and enter your email address and password for your
Heroku account.  Answer yes when it prompts you whether to upload your
`ssh` public key.  Now you're all set to use Heroku from the command
line.

Write Your App
--------------

You may be starting from an existing app.  If not, here's a simple
"hello, world" sourcefile you can use:

### web.js

    var express = require('express');

    var app = express.createServer(express.logger());

    app.get('/', function(request, response) {
      response.send('Hello World!');
    });

    var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(port, function() {
      console.log("Listening on " + port);
    });

Declare Dependencies With NPM
-----------------------------

Cedar recognizes an app as Node.js by the existence of a `package.json`.
Here's an example `package.json` for the Express app we created above:

### package.json

    {
      "name": "node-example",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "2.2.0"
      }
    }

Run `npm install` to install your dependencies locally.

You'll also want to prevent NPM installed packages from going into
revision control with this file:

### .gitignore

    node_modules

Make sure that all of your app's dependencies are declared in
`package.json` and that you are not relying on any system-level
packages.

Declare Process Types With Foreman/Procfile
-------------------------------------------

To run your web process, you need to declare what command to use.  In
this case, we simply need to execute `web.js` with the Node runtime.
We'll use `Procfile` to declare how our web process type is run.

Here's a `Procfile` for the sample app we've been working on:

    web: node web.js

Optional, but highly recommended, is to test that the `Procfile` works
correctly using the [Foreman][9] tool, available as Ruby gem:

    $ gem install foreman
    $ foreman start
    14:39:04 web.1     | started with pid 24384
    14:39:04 web.1     | Listening on 5000

Your app will come up on port 5000.  Test that it's working with `curl`
or a web browser, then Ctrl-C to exit.

Deploy to Heroku/Cedar
----------------------

Store the app in Git:

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "init"

Create the app on the Cedar stack:

    $ heroku create --stack cedar
    Creating radiant-river-296... done, stack is cedar
    http://radiant-river-296.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:radiant-river-296.git
    Git remote heroku added

Deploy your code:

    $ git push heroku master
    Counting objects: 9, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 923 bytes, done.

    To git@heroku.com:radiant-river-296.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master

Before looking at the app on the web, we'll need to scale the web
process:

    $ heroku ps:scale web=1
    Scaling web processes... done, now running 1

Now, let's check the state of the app's processes:

    $ heroku ps
    Process       State               Command
    ------------  ------------------  --------------------------------------------
    web.1         up for 10s          node web.js

The web process is up.  Review [the logs][10] for more information:

    $ heroku logs
    2011-03-10T10:22:30-08:00 heroku[web.1]: State changed from created to starting
    2011-03-10T10:22:32-08:00 heroku[web.1]: Running process with command: `node web.js`
    2011-03-10T10:22:33-08:00 heroku[web.1]: Listening on 18320
    2011-03-10T10:22:34-08:00 heroku[web.1]: State changed from starting to up

Looks good.  You can now visit the app with `heroku open`.

Add Collaborators
-----------------

To add your Node Knockout team members to the app, use the `sharing:add`
command:

    $ heroku sharing:add jane@example.com
    jane@example.com added as a collaborator on radiant-river-296.

Console
-------

Cedar allows you to launch a REPL process attached to your local
terminal for experimenting in your app's environment:

    $ heroku run node
    Running `node` attached to terminal... up, ps.1
    >

This console has nothing loaded other than the Node.js standard library.
From here you can `require` some of your application files.

Advanced HTTP Features
----------------------

The HTTP stack available to Cedar apps on the `herokuapp.com` subdomain
supports HTTP 1.1, long polling, and chunked responses.  [Ryan Dahl's
chat example][14] is deployed on Heroku [here][15] as a long-polling
example.

The WebSockets protocol is still in changing rapidly and is not yet
supported on the Cedar stack.

Running a Worker
----------------

The `Procfile` format lets you run any number of different [process
types][17].  For example, let's say you wanted a worker process to
complement your web process:

#### Procfile

    web: node web.js
    worker: node worker.js

Push this change to Heroku, then launch a worker:

    $ heroku ps:scale worker=1
    Scaling worker processes... done, now running 1

All apps get 750 dyno-hours free per month.  This means you can run a
[process formation][18] of up to 750 dyno-hours / 48 hours = about 15
dynos for the duration of Node Knockout without incurring any charges,
as long as you scale back down to one or zero dynos at the end.  If your
app only uses one web process, then you don't need to worry about this
at all.

Using a Postgres Database
-------------------------

To add a PostgreSQL database to your app, run this command:

    $ heroku addons:add shared-database

This sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  Add the `postgres`
NPM module to your dependencies:

    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "pg": "0.5.4"
    }

And use the module to connect to `DATABASE_URL` from somewhere in your
code:

    var pg = require('pg');

    pg.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL, function(err, client) {
      var query = client.query('SELECT * FROM your_table');

      query.on('row', function(row) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(row));
      });
    });

Using Redis
-----------

To add a Redis database to your app, run this command:

    $ heroku addons:add redistogo

This sets the `REDISTOGO_URL` environment variable.  Add the `redis-url`
NPM module to your dependencies:

    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "redis-url": "0.0.1"
    }

And use the module to connect to `REDISTOGO_URL` from somewhere in your
code:

    var redis = require('redis-url').connect(process.env.REDISTOGO_URL);

    redis.set('foo', 'bar');

    redis.get('foo', function(err, value) {
      console.log('foo is: ' + value);
    });

Other Backing Services
----------------------

Many other services are available in the Heroku [add-ons catalog][21]
for free, including [MongoDB][22], [CouchDB][23], [advanced full text
indexing][24], [Memcached][25], [realtime publishing][26], [Neo4j][27],
and [SMS publishing][28].

Adding a Custom Domain
----------------------

Your app automatically gets a hostname like
`furious-river-173.herokuapp.com`.  You can change the first part with
[`heroku rename`][29] or by setting a name when you create the app
initially.  You can also use [your own domain name][30].
